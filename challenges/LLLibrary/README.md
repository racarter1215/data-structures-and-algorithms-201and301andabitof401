# Code Challenge 05

## Linked List Implementation
### Author: Robert Carter


### Problem Domain

#### This code challenge is all about moving through linked lists and verifying that one is doing it correclty. Amanda, the class, and I created several methods and Classes to created linked lists and allow ourselves to navigate through them utilizing the Head, Cuurent, and Next node logic. We did this through creating tests for our problem sets and then creating methods that enable said tests to run. The end result is fully tested code that seamlessly and correctly identifies individual nodes within a list as well as move through them without throwing errors
